# YouTube Research Foundation

This skill provides the research foundation for all GAP Intel analysis. Contains validated research findings on YouTube algorithm mechanics, growth drivers, and optimization best practices.

## When to Use This Skill

- Need benchmark values for metrics
- Understanding YouTube algorithm priorities (2025)
- Making decisions about metric thresholds
- Validating analysis outputs against research
- Explaining why certain recommendations matter

## YouTube Algorithm 2025: Satisfaction-First Ranking

### Algorithm Priority (Current)

```
1. Viewer Satisfaction (Primary) - 50% weight
   - Survey responses from built-in tools
   - "Not interested" click frequency (negative)
   - Return viewer behavior
   - Post-watch session continuation

2. Engagement Metrics (Secondary) - 30% weight
   - Click-through rate (CTR)
   - Watch time and retention
   - Likes, comments, shares
   - Subscriber conversion rate

3. Content Quality & Relevance (Tertiary) - 20% weight
   - Metadata optimization
   - Topic relevance to search
   - Content freshness
   - Channel authority
```

**Key Insight**: YouTube now prioritizes viewer SATISFACTION over raw watch time. Analysis should focus on satisfaction signals and engagement quality.

### Expected Watch Time Per Impression

```
Video Ranking ∝ E[Watch Time per Impression]

Where:
E[Watch Time] = Average View Duration × Impression Count

A video with 50% view duration + 1000 impressions 
ranks higher than 80% view duration + 200 impressions
```

## Growth Drivers (Research-Backed)

| Driver | Impact | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Upload Consistency** | +156% | Weekly uploads optimal |
| **Community Engagement** | +134% | Live streaming, comments |
| **Content Series** | +89% | Playlists drive binge-watching |
| **Multi-Format Strategy** | +156% | Long-form + Shorts combo |
| **Community-First** | +92% | Brand ambassadors, collaborations |

## Engagement Benchmarks

### Comment-to-View Ratio (CVR)

| Content Type | Baseline | Good | Exceptional |
|--------------|----------|------|-------------|
| Educational | 1-2% | 2-3% | 3-5% |
| Tutorials | 0.5-1% | 1-2% | 2-3% |
| Entertainment | 0.1-0.5% | 0.5-1% | 1-2% |

### Question Density in Comments

| Quality Level | Percentage |
|--------------|------------|
| High-quality educational | 30-40% |
| Mixed content | 15-25% |
| Low-quality | <10% |

### Like Rate Benchmarks

| Content Type | Baseline | Good | Exceptional |
|--------------|----------|------|-------------|
| Tutorials | 2-3% | 3-4% | 5%+ |
| Reviews | 3-4% | 4-5% | 5%+ |
| Entertainment | 1-2% | 2-3% | 4%+ |
| Educational | 2-3% | 3-4% | 5%+ |

### Comment Rate Benchmarks

| Quality | Rate |
|---------|------|
| Average | 0.5-1% |
| Good | 1-2% |
| Exceptional | 3%+ |

## CTR Benchmarks

| Audience Size | Baseline | Target | Exceptional |
|---------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Under 100K | 2-4% | 4-6% | 8%+ |
| 100K-1M | 1.5-3% | 3-5% | 6%+ |
| Over 1M | 1-2% | 2-4% | 5%+ |

## Growth Velocity Benchmarks

| Growth Phase | Subscriber Count | Expected Monthly Growth |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Early Traction | 0-1,000 | 50-200 |
| Growth Phase | 1,000-10,000 | 200-1,000 |
| Acceleration | 10,000-100,000 | 1,000-5,000 |
| Mature | 100K+ | 5,000-20,000+ |

## Title Optimization Research

### Length Optimization
- **Optimal**: 50-60 characters
- Mobile truncation: >60 chars gets cut
- Primary keyword: within first 30 characters

### Hook Effectiveness (CTR Boost)

| Pattern | Formula | CTR Boost |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Number List | "7 Ways to..." | +35% |
| How-To | "How to [Action]..." | +28% |
| Question | "Why...?" | +20% |
| Comparison | "X vs Y" | +18% |
| Ultimate Guide | "Ultimate Guide to..." | +22% |
| Urgency/Year | "[Topic] 2025" | +15% |

## Description Best Practices

### Structure
```
Line 1 (Hook): Compelling value + primary keyword
Lines 2-5 (Overview): What viewer will learn
Line 6: Link or CTA
Timestamps: Chapter breakdown (+20% engagement)
End: Hashtags (#3-5)
```

### Front-Load Impact
- First 100-150 characters MUST:
  - State clear benefit
  - Include primary keyword
  - Create curiosity/urgency

## Comment Analysis Value

### Comment Intent Distribution

| Intent | Frequency | GAP Intel Value |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| How-to Question | 30-40% | High - procedural gap |
| Why/Explanation | 15-25% | High - understanding gap |
| Comparison | 10-15% | High - comparison gap |
| Implementation | 8-12% | Very High - validation |
| Problem Report | 8-12% | High - troubleshooting gap |
| Praise/Feedback | 10-15% | Low - community signal |

### Sentiment Correlation
- Comment sentiment has r=0.73 correlation with video retention
- Positive comments indicate content satisfaction
- Questions indicate knowledge gaps (opportunities)

## Content Gap Framework

### True Gap Identification
```
High Viewer Demand + Low Channel Supply = TRUE GAP
→ Action: Create new content

High Demand + Poor Coverage = UNDER_EXPLAINED
→ Action: Expand/improve existing content

Low Demand + High Supply = LOW PRIORITY
→ Action: Avoid or reduce focus
```

### Gap Scoring Formula
```
Gap Score = (Demand × Competitor Gap) / Existing Coverage

Where:
- Demand: Question frequency + search volume + urgency
- Competitor Gap: Topics competitors don't cover well
- Coverage: Videos already addressing this topic
```

## Confidence Levels for Outputs

### High Confidence (85%+ validated)
- Comment questions = demand indicator
- Engagement quality = content satisfaction
- Topic coverage gaps = supply gaps
- Metadata optimization = CTR improvements

### Medium Confidence (70-85%)
- Subscriber growth predictions
- Under-explanation detection
- Format recommendations

### Lower Confidence (50-70%)
- Watch time predictions (no direct data)
- Specific growth predictions
- Micro-niche forecasting

## Quality Gates

### Minimum Sample Sizes
- Comments: >50 for reliable analysis
- Videos: >20 for pattern recognition
- Competitor channels: >10 for benchmarking

### Confidence Thresholds
- Each skill output: >65% confidence
- Gap recommendations: >70% confidence
- Growth predictions: Use conservative estimates

## Data Limitations

### Available via Public API
✅ Titles, descriptions, tags
✅ View, like, comment counts
✅ Comment text and metadata
✅ Subscriber counts
✅ Upload dates

### NOT Available
❌ Watch time / retention curves
❌ Audience demographics
❌ Revenue data
❌ Click-through rates
