Join me as I discuss it playing Terraria.\n\nBetween the pressures of a 9-to-5 job and the hustle culture we see online everywhere, it feels like we are holding ourselves to a standard that is simply impossible to maintain at least in my opinion.\n\nIn my eight episode (I think), I am discussing the myth of constant productivity and why I am choosing to lower my daily expectations in favour of actual progress.\n\nI talk about the guilt of doing nothing (we all face) and how our obsession with output is actually making us less effective at building the lives we want. \n\nInstead of chasing a perfect routine, I am looking for pockets of peace in a corporate world that seems relentless. This is a ramble about honestly just reclaiming your time from the pressure of always having to be a switched on.\n\nTimeline:\n0:00 - 1:30 Intro\n1:31 - 2:46 The myth of productivity\n2:47 - 3:41 Why we feel guilty being unproductive\n3:42 - 5:11 The importance of setting realistic goals\n5:12 - 5:51 Why it's okay to do nothing\n5:52 - 7:30 Why we need hobbies\n7:31 - 8:32 Outro\n\n#terraria #joshyouare #corporatelife",

Economic Tradeoffs of Modern Livestock Breeds,\u201d we unpack the hidden economics behind today\u2019s high-yield animals\u2014and the tough choices farmers face when chasing maximum output.\n\nModern livestock breeds can grow faster, produce more milk, or lay more eggs than ever before. But higher productivity often comes with higher feed bills, rising veterinary costs, tighter management demands, and greater vulnerability to market swings.\n\nIn this video, you\u2019ll discover:\n\u2022 \ud83e\uddec Why modern livestock breeds were selected for extreme productivity\n\u2022 \ud83d\udcb8 How higher yields can also mean higher feed, health, and care costs\n\u2022 \ud83c\udfe5 Why veterinary dependence increases as genetics become more specialized\n\u2022 \ud83d\udcc9 How market volatility can turn high-output systems into high-risk systems\n\u2022 \ud83c\udf0d Real farmer experiences balancing productivity with resilience\n\u2022 \ud83d\udd04 Why some farms are reintroducing hardier or mixed-breed systems\n\nWhether you raise cattle, poultry, pigs, or small ruminants, this episode challenges the assumption that \u201cmore is always better\u201d and explores how profitability, animal welfare, and long-term resilience are deeply connected.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Stay until the end to see how future breeding strategies may focus less on maximum output\u2014and more on efficiency, health, and adaptability in an uncertain world.\n\n#LivestockEconomics #ModernBreeds #FarmProfitability #AnimalHealth #SustainableLivestock #AgriTrends #ResilientFarming #farmtipsdiary",
