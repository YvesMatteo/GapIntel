The front(tapa) is 12x18 1/8\" Birch plywood. I cut a 4\" sound hole on the back 6\" from the top. Filled small holes and cracks with wood putty, sanded all really well and rounded the corners on the face. I stained the body dark walnut and then put clear poly over it all. I added rubber feet I already had to the bottom. The natural birch front looks nice with the contrasting dark body. A snare could be added inside as well. A simple fun musical wood project.\ud83d\ude42",

    "description": "How to Achieve Perfect Edge Finishes Fast with Festool HLC 82.\nWhen speed, precision, and surface quality matter on site, compromise is not an option. The Festool HLC 82 cordless planer is designed for professionals who need flawless results without being tied to a power cord.\n\nWhether you\u2019re chamfering beams, adjusting doors, straightening wallboard edges, or working through renovation challenges, the Festool HLC 82 delivers consistent performance where it counts. Powered by an EC-TEC brushless motor and compatible with Festool\u2019s 18V battery system, it provides strong, reliable cutting power even at maximum chip depth.\n\nWhat sets the Festool HLC 82 apart is the spiral blade with drawing cut. This design produces a noticeably finer surface finish, dramatically reducing sanding time and delivering professional results straight off the tool. It also operates more quietly, making it ideal for busy construction sites and renovation environments.\n\nWith up to 2.5 mm chip removal and a rebate depth of 25 mm, the Festool HLC 82 handles both quick touch-ups and demanding adjustment work. Three integrated V grooves make accurate chamfering fast and repeatable, while the removable chamfer adaptor ensures clean, consistent edges on beams and square timbers.\n\nFlexibility is built in. Dual dust extraction ports allow you to work comfortably from either side, keeping hoses out of the way and improving workflow. Combined with Festool dust extractors, the HLC 82 supports cleaner, safer job sites with excellent chip control even during heavy material removal.\n\nIf you\u2019re a carpenter, builder, or renovation professional looking to upgrade your cordless setup, the Festool HLC 82 is built to save time, reduce fatigue, and protect the quality of your work. Fewer mistakes, less rework, and a finish you can stand behind.\n\nHave you used the Festool HLC 82 on site?

    "description": "I Built the Ultimate Workstation for My Table Saw (Router Lift, T-Track & Storage)In this video, I build a custom woodworking workstation designed to be the backbone of my shop.

Thanks! \n\nThe build starts with a reinforced 2x4 base using pocket hole joinery and 45-degree bracing to eliminate racking. Adjustable leg levelers ensure the workstation sits perfectly flat on an uneven concrete floor, which is critical for precision cuts and long-term stability. The open design and low shelf maximize storage while allowing long lumber to be stored inside the workstation.\n\nThe worktop is made from laminated \u00be-inch plywood, cut simultaneously with a track saw for perfect alignment. I secure the top using figure-8 fasteners to allow seasonal movement, then finish the edges with birch edge banding for durability and a clean, professional look.\n\nTo improve cleanliness and airflow, I build a custom dust collection solution for my older Rockwell table saw using a dedicated panel and magnetic dust ports for quick connection. I also install full overlay cabinet doors using euro-style hinges, walking through precise layout, pilot hole drilling, shimming, and fine adjustment for perfect door alignment.\n\nThe workstation also includes a router lift installed flush with the worktop, along with a T-track router fence system for fast, repeatable adjustments and effective dust collection. One of my favorite features is the hard maple T-track clamping station mounted to the end of the bench, giving me powerful and flexible workholding for wide panels, glue-ups, sanding, and assembly work.\n\nThis workstation was designed to grow with the shop. It\u2019s rigid, modular, and built for real woodworking \u2014 improving workflow, accuracy, and efficiency on every project.\n\n\ud83d\udc55 Shopfix T-Shirts & Apparel \u2192 https://shopfix.store/\nRep your passion for woodworking with exclusive Shopfix shirts & merch!\n\n#woodworking #diy #diywoodworking #woodwork #woodworkingtips",

    "description": "This one is just for the Smart Fam.\nToday I\u2019m pulling back the curtain and showing you exactly what goes on behind the scenes at The Smart Woodshop. No woodworking builds in this video. No tool reviews. Instead, I\u2019m walking you through the camera and audio setup I\u2019m using to make these videos clearer, more informative, and more engaging.\nI break down my current four-camera system, including the main cam, POV cam, overhead cam, and a head-mounted option that follows where I look. I explain why I\u2019m shooting in 8K and delivering in 4K, how that helps with framing and cropping in post, and why running matching cameras matters for batteries, storage, and syncing.\nI also cover my DJI audio setup, how I\u2019m handling interviews, and why consistent sound across videos is something I\u2019m actively working to improve.\nThis video is also about what\u2019s coming next. I\u2019ve got new tool videos in the pipeline, including the DeWalt Grabo, a new adjustable Trailer Valet hitch, and a follow-up on Router Table 2. And in 2025, my big goal is to come visit your shops, record your setups, and share them with the rest of the Smart Fam.\nIf you\u2019re into the behind-the-scenes side of content creation, this one\u2019s for you. And if you\u2019re not, feel free to jump ahead and come back for the woodworking.\nDrop your feedback in the comments.
