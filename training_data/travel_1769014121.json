This journey was full of beauty, culture, and emotions \u2764\ufe0f.\n\nI visited the famous Dal Lake and enjoyed a peaceful Shikara ride, soaking in the breathtaking views all around. I even had the chance to pull a Shikara myself, which made the experience even more special and memorable.\n\nAfter that, I explored Lal Chowk (Clock Tower), one of the most iconic places in Srinagar. I also visited the local markets, did some shopping, met many warm and friendly people, and learned more about the local lifestyle and culture.\n\nOverall, it was an amazing and enriching experience that I will always remember.

    "description": "Raohe Night Market is a celebrated food paradise in Taipei, renowned for its vibrant atmosphere and concentration of authentic Taiwanese street food, including several Michelin-recommended stalls. Unlike larger, more sprawling markets, Raohe features a single, easy-to-navigate 600-meter street, making it an ideal destination for an immersive culinary experience.\n\nLocated in the Songshan district, at one end of the market stands the ornate Ciyou Temple, which is beautifully lit at night and adds a cultural dimension to the visit. The air is filled with the sizzle of woks and the aroma of diverse spices, guiding visitors through a plethora of food stalls, carnival games, and souvenir shops. The market is popular with both locals and tourists, offering an authentic slice of Taipei nightlife.\n\nDive into Taipei's culinary heaven! \ud83c\udfee From savory pepper buns to endless noodle bowls, Raohe Night Market is a feast for the senses. Every corner holds a new delicious surprise.\n\nRaohe Night Market is home to a wide array of delicious dishes. Be sure to arrive hungry and bring cash for the most convenient experience.\nFuzhou Pepper Buns: The undisputed star of the market, these are a must-try. The buns are baked in a traditional cylindrical clay oven, resulting in a crispy exterior and a juicy, peppery pork and green onion filling. The stall is located right at the market entrance near the temple and often has a long but fast-moving queue.\nChen Tung Pork Ribs Medicinal Herbs Soup: Another Michelin Bib Gourmand-recognized stall, this dish features tender pork ribs simmered in a light, naturally sweet, and soothing herbal broth. It's the perfect comfort food, especially on a cooler evening.\nCrispy Fried Stinky Tofu: Don't let the pungent aroma deter you; this Taiwanese classic is deep-fried to golden perfection, crispy on the outside and soft inside, and typically served with pickled cabbage and a spicy sauce.\nOyster Vermicelli: This comforting bowl of silky thin noodles in a savory broth with fresh oysters is a seafood lover's delight.\nGrilled King Oyster Mushrooms: A popular vegetarian option, these mushrooms are grilled to perfection, smoky and juicy, and can be seasoned with various spices like cumin or black pepper.\nTaiwanese Sausage: A slightly sweet and savory snack, these juicy sausages are often served on a stick, perfect for enjoying as you stroll.\nVisitor Information\nLocation: Raohe Street, Songshan Di\n\nExperience the vibrant energy of Raohe Night Market in Taipei, a true foodie's paradise with incredible street food options. This travel vlog captures the bustling atmosphere and delicious eats, making it a must-see for anyone planning Taiwan travel. Discover why this night market is a highlight of Taipei's culinary scene. \ud83e\udd29\n\nRaohe Night Market is a celebrated food paradise in Taipei, renowned for its vibrant atmosphere and concentration of authentic Taiwanese street food, including several Michelin-recommended stalls. Unlike larger, more sprawling markets, Raohe features a single, easy-to-navigate 600-meter street, making it an ideal destination for an immersive culinary experience.\n\nHours: The market is open daily from around 5:00 PM until midnight, with most stalls open by 6:00 or 7:00 PM. Visiting earlier in the evening helps avoid the peak crowds.\n\nUnlike some sprawling night markets where you zigzag like a drunk tourist on a scooter, Raohe is basically one straight street \u2014 which is dangerous, because you can see every single temptation lined up ahead of you. Here\u2019s how my highly scientific eating strategy went:\n\n1. Start from the temple end \u2014 that\u2019s where the pepper bun stall is.\n\n2. Move slowly \u2014 like, really slowly. Half the fun is watching the vendors do their thing.\n\n3. Follow your nose \u2014 it will lead you to magic.",
