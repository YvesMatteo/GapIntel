I begin my journey on a low dose of 2.5 mg with the advice to increase to 5.0 mg and 7.5 mg of Mounjaro or Tirzepatide.\nAfter 3 months I lost an amazing 20kg 3.2 stone or 44 pounds\n There are many stories of people, especially on YouTube and TiKTok, of people losing anywhere from 60 to more than 100 pounds, but what happens when you reach your weight loss goal? what happens when you stop using Mounjaro?\n\nGUIDE DOGS FOR THE BLIND SUPPORT BELOW\nPlease help support Guide Dogs for the blind through Dry January. Buy me a coffee / Buy me a Guinness and I will happily add you to the credits or give you a special mention in the vlog as well as match all donations at the end of Dry January using the link below.\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/abroadyorkshire\nYESOUL Fitness\nInstagram: @yesoulfitness.official\nYouTube: @YESOUL Fitness\nLINK AbroadYorkshire https://bit.ly/4ppfw7Y\nSubscribe here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLttWDYIH1BPArXHUIGLvbQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nComment here\n@abroadyorkshire\n\nEmail here\nabroadyorkshire@gmail.com\n\nSee our European trip playlist including the best of Benidorm\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPLhWa36vPecyfJPOKOvoE5KEAU4RSg--\n\nFor more days out around the UK see this playlist \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPLhWa36vPedHKK9XCh6twR1gWN-MI7ad",

    "description": "Weight-loss injections like Ozempic (Semaglutide) are becoming increasingly popular \u2014 but how safe are they, and are they really a long-term solution?\n\nAs a Cardiologist, it\u2019s important to speak honestly and responsibly about weight-loss medicines .This medication has shown promising results in helping people with obesity reduce body fat by improving insulin sensitivity, controlling blood sugar, and significantly reducing appetite. For some patients, it can be a helpful medical tool when lifestyle changes alone are not enough.\n\nHowever, this is not a magic solution. Rapid weight loss with Semaglutide may also lead to muscle loss, especially if protein intake and strength training are neglected. Patients may experience side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness, nutritional deficiencies, and in some cases, worsening gut health. Long-term or unsupervised use may also affect metabolism once the medication is stopped, leading to weight regain.\n\nWeight-loss medicines should always be used under medical supervision, combined with a balanced diet, adequate protein, resistance exercise, and regular follow-ups. Sustainable fat loss is not just about losing weight on the scale, but about protecting muscle, organs, and overall health.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f This video is for educational purposes only.

    "description": "#GLP1 #Ozempic #WeightLoss #Semaglutide #Tirzepatide #Retatrutide\n\nIf you're starting a GLP-1 medication, there are a few things you probably didn't hear from your doctor. \n\nThese drugs can lead to incredible fat loss and preserved muscle, or hair loss, wrecked metabolism, and skinny-fat outcomes. \n\nIn this video, I break down exactly how these medications work, why 25 to 40 percent of weight loss can be muscle if you're not careful, and what you need to do to protect yourself.\n\nYou'll learn about:\n\n\u2022 How your metabolism actually works (and why both \"just eat less\" and \"heal your metabolism\" are wrong)\n\u2022 Why obesity is typically an under-muscled problem, not an over-fat problem\n\u2022 The science behind muscle as your body's glucose sink and why it matters for insulin resistance\n\u2022 How semaglutide, tirzepatide, and retatrutide work differently on your metabolism\n\u2022 Why these drugs make nutrition MORE important, not less\n\u2022 The cascade of problems from protein deficiency: muscle loss, metabolic slowdown, hormone disruption, brain fog, hair loss\n\u2022 Why the peptide community's approach is the same pharmaceutical treadmill they claim to hate\n\u2022 Recovery markers to track before problems become visible\n\u2022 The exact protocol: protein targets, training frequency, and sleep priorities\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Disclaimer: This video is for informational purposes only and not medical advice.

The discussion unpacks why Novo Nordisk has surged sharply, driven by the success of its oral GLP-1 weight-loss tablet, a major breakthrough over injectables that faced resistance, especially in India. Anand explains why investors haven\u2019t \u201cmissed the boat,\u201d while also highlighting patent expiry risks, rising competition from Indian pharma players like Dr. Reddy\u2019s and Natco, and the long-term nature of GLP-1 treatments. The episode explores India\u2019s massive diabetes opportunity, recurring revenue potential for pharma companies, Eli Lilly\u2019s competitive landscape, and why obesity drugs could become one of the most durable healthcare investment themes of the decade.\n\n#BeRich #NovoNordisk #ObesityDrugs #WeightLossDrugs #GLP1 #PharmaStocks #HealthcareInvesting #PharmaBoom #DiabetesMarket #IndianPharma #LongTermInvesting #StockMarketIndia #GlobalMarkets #InvestorEducation #HealthcareStocks #WeightLossPills #ObesityCrisis #GLP1Revolution #PharmaInvesting #HealthcareTrends #MedicalBreakthrough #DiabetesCure #ChronicDisease #GlobalPharma #DrugInnovation #PharmaGrowth #StockMarketEducation #MacroInvesting #WealthCreation #BeRichShow\n\n_________\n\nAnandSrinivasan:\nFollow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/anandsrinivasan/\nFollow me on X : https://twitter.com/anandsrini3\n\n__________\n\nVinodSrinivasan:\nFollow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/vinodsrinivasan_/ \nFollow me on X                : https://twitter.com/vinodsrini_\n\n__________\n\nThe Economic Channel in English for you to see speeches, interviews and special guest programs that Mr. Anand Srinivasan appears on a daily basis, Here the common man can understand the various things about Global Economy, Stock markets, Investment, Gold, Real Estate etc.\n\n#WorldEconomy #IndianEconomy #PersonalFinance #Insurance #StockMarket #BSE #NSE #DalalStreet #Sensex #NIfty #Nifty50 #NiftyBank #AnandSrinivasan #MoneyPechu #MoneyPechuWebsite #berich #economist\n\nOur Sister Channels:\n\n\u0bae\u0ba3\u0bbf \u0baa\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bc1 - MoneyPechu -   \nhttps://youtube.com/@moneypechu?si=_Jsr856KH37SN79o\n\n\u0ba4\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb5 \u0baa\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bc1 - Thathuva Pechu - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrfwMUFeZZ4RBO7xTkmD3QA\n\n\u0bae\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bc1 - Makkal Pechu - https://www.youtube.com/c/MakkalPechu\n\n\u0b89\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bbe\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bbf - Ungal Property - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAQZDrqbCRYgpDRfrGJNaIA\n\nPaisa Boltha Hai (Hindi) - https://www.youtube.com/c/PaisaBoltaHai1\n\n_________\n\n\u0b86\u0ba9\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bcd \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc0\u0ba9\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0b9a\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b85\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baf \u0baa\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0b95\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc8 \u0ba8\u0bc7\u0bb0\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe\u0b95 \u0b8e\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0b9f\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bbe\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95, \u0b95\u0bc0\u0bb4\u0bc7 \u0b89\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0bb3 \u0b87\u0ba3\u0bc8\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bcd\u0baf\u0bb5\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd :\nhttps://rb.gy/joptqf\n\n_______\n\n\u0b86\u0ba9\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bcd \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc0\u0ba9\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0b9a\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b85\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baf \u0baa\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0b95\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc8 \u0b85\u0bae\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bbf\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bbe\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95.\n\n\u0baa\u0ba3\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0ba9\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bae\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd (\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd)\nhttps://www.amazon.in/dp/B09QKKXW6S/r... \n\n\n\u0b9a\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0ba3 \u0baa\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0b85\u0b9a\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0ba3 \u0bb2\u0bbe\u0baa\u0bae\u0bcd (\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd)\nhttps://www.amazon.in/dp/B093GBKNR8\n\nOrdinary Stocks, Extra Ordinary Profits (English)\nhttps://www.amazon.in/dp/B01L43JF16/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_4DT6TGV33HBMRTPXMOTF\n\nAlchemy Of Money: (English)\nhttps://www.amazon.in/dp/B01L43JF16/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_ZB862XNSD6QHX9H7NT44\n\nAll About Mutual Fund : (English)\nhttps://www.amazon.in/dp/B0C4B7F4QT/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=all+about+mutual+funds+by+anand+srinivasan&qid\n=1683285165&sprefix=all+about+mutu%2Caps%2C210&sr=8-5\n\n=================\nContent created, managed and distributed by  - CORONA CREATIVE SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED.\n=========================\n#AnandSrinivasan #PersonalFinance #FinancialPlanning #FinancialLiteracy #FinancialFreedom #RetirementPlanning #finance #money #trading #investment #loan #investing #stockmarket #wealth #economy #StockMarketInsights #InvestingTips #Budgeting #StockMarketTips #SavingsGoals #DebtFreeJourney, #PassiveIncome #TaxTips #InvestingTips #WealthBuilding #MillennialFinanceIndia #MutualFundsIndia #InsuranceIndia #GlobalEconomics #EmergingMarkets #EconomicPolicy #TradeMarkets #FinancialLiteracyIndia #vinodsrinivasan",
