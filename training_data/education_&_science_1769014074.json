When plaiting my hair I made sure I combed through my hair and added more product as needed. I used the gray perm rods to seal my ends and sat under the dryer for about an hour. I used Mane Nutrients Mango Growth Oil for takedown and separated my hair at the natural gaps to reduce frizz.\n\nIf you are interested, please check out my hair care line @ManeNutrients all products used in this video are from my line, and you can use the code \"CEO\" at checkout for $$$ off your order.\n\nProducts Used: @ManeNutrients \n- Mango Growth Oil: https://manenutrients.com/products/growth-oil\n-Mango Dynamic Duo: https://manenutrients.com/products/dynamic-duo\n\nSubscriber Count: 79,039\n\n\nKeywords: braid out, braid and curl, 2026 hair care routine, natural hair 2026, basic natural hairstyles, overnight natural hair, what to do to my hair",
