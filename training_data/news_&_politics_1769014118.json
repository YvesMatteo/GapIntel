His administration has previously backed the deal.\n \nThe UK said it has to hand over the islands because the military base is under threat \"after court decisions undermined our position\".\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Greenland #ChagosIslands #BBCNews",

Rescue teams, including the fire brigade, struggled to access the site due to narrow spaces and water shortages. Survivors and eyewitnesses report harrowing scenes, while critics ask: \u201cHas any inquiry been conducted? Who is accountable?\u201d\n\nRenowned journalist Zafar Abbas expressed outrage over the mishandling of the rescue operations, demanding that all bodies be recovered fully and respectfully, without leaving behind any human parts. Families of the victims have raised their voices for justice and accountability, highlighting the lack of preparedness in the face of such disasters.\n\nSaddar Gul Plaza traders are crying for help after a devastating fire destroyed their businesses on M.A. Jinnah Road, Karachi. Traders say their goods and lifelong investments have been completely burned, and now they fear for their safety as the building remains dangerous. \u201cPlease save us,\u201d they plead, urging authorities to take immediate action.\n\nTanveer Qasim Ropray, representing Saddar Gul Plaza traders, stated that while property and businesses have been destroyed, saving lives must now be the top priority.

    "description": "As always, we have a number of important stories in the news to highlight...\n\n\"All Options on the Table\": Israel Braces for US Move Against Tehran (JFEED, N12)\n\nIran Says Executions May Proceed, Warns Any Attack on Leader Signals \u2018All-Out War\u2019 (Epoch Times)\n\nGaza technocratic panel meets for first time, as officials fear it\u2019s hobbled from get-go (Times of Israel)\n\nAs we begin a new week, we are again faced with a number of future unknowns. Will the United States stage a military strike against Iran? If so, what will be the outcome with respect to the present regime?\n\nWill the new Board of Peace accomplish the dismantling of Hamas, its leadership as well as weapons? \n\nFor a comprehensive look at what the Scripture has to say about the time of the end, please see our books 25 Signs We Are Near The End, The Ezekiel 38,39 Invasion, and Lookup: A Timeline of 50 last days events. Put together, they give a thorough look at what the Bible says will take place. \n\nOther books, such as the Final Antichrist: The Coming Caesar, and the Jews, Jerusalem and the Coming Temple, add to our knowledge of what will take place.\n\nAll of these books are free downloads from our website educatingourworld under the heading of Bible Prophecy. Please take advantage of them and tell others about them.\n\nHeadline 1 \"All Options on the Table\": Israel Braces for US Move Against Tehran (JFEED, N12)\n\nIsraeli security officials detect rapid US military reinforcement in the Middle East that could be complete within days, fueling assessments that President Trump is nearing a decision on a broad offensive against Iran while the IDF maintains maximum readiness. \n\nIsraeli defense and security establishments have identified a significant acceleration in American force deployment across the Middle East, a buildup expected to reach full operational capacity within just a few days and potentially enable Washington to launch an extensive military operation against Iran if the decision is made. \n\nThis is the \u201cbig story,\u201d \n\nFurthermore, as we have noted, any potential war with Iran is NOT the fulfillment of any specific last day\u2019s biblical prediction. \n\nSadly, if another war breaks out, there will be those who claim this is the fulfillment of Scripture. We have explained why it is not in our book 25 Signs We Are Near The End, Appendix 4, Israel\u2019s Regional Wars With Iran Have Nothing To Do With Ezekiel 38,39... Please look at carefully at what the Bible specifically says...\n\nHeadline 2 Iran Says Executions May Proceed, Warns Any Attack on Leader Signals \u2018All-Out War\u2019 (Epoch Times)\n\nThe Iranian regime warned on Jan. 18 that \u201cany aggression\u201d against its leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, would amount to waging \u201call-out war\u201d against Iran, and indicated it may proceed with executing hundreds of citizens detained during protests that have swept the country over the last three weeks.\n\nFaced with a worsening economy and skyrocketing inflation, Iranian citizens have amassed in the largest wave of protests to hit the nation since its 1979 Islamic revolution, taking to the streets on Dec. 28, 2025, to call for an end to the Islamist regime\u2019s theocratic clerical rule.\n\nMoving to Gaza, we discover that there are still huge problems try to sort out the situation.\n\nHeadline 3 Gaza technocratic panel meets for first time, as officials fear it\u2019s hobbled from get-go (Times of Israel)\n\n... A US official confirmed the Israeli opposition to even lower-level PA involvement in the management of Gaza but said the issue would be addressed in the coming weeks, adding that the meeting in Cairo was more aimed at \u201csetting the tone for the work that lies ahead.\u201d\n\nThe US official said that if mediators can make progress on disarming Hamas \u2014 which Washington thinks is possible \u2014 then Israel will be more flexible regarding a role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza.\n\nBut talks with Hamas on disarmament are still in their initial stages, US officials acknowledged during a briefing on Wednesday.\n\nThe elephant in the room is the necessary disarmament of Hamas. Who is going to do it? When will it be done? Is there a timeline? Recall, Trump recently gave them another ultimatum, demilitarize or else? So, the question remains, \u201cor else, what?\u201d\n\nIn sum, as we have noted, both Iran and Gaza are flashpoints with no clear indications of what will happen in the short term. Therefore, we must have a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude. \n\nWe will continue to bring you the latest...\n\nSupport the ministry of Don Stewart here:\n\nhttps://goinchrist.com/our-misionaries-m/entry/7251 \n\nGet access to all the materials from Pastor Don Stewart here:\nhttp://educatingourworld.com/\n\nFollow Pastor Don Stewart\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/EducatingOurWorld/",
