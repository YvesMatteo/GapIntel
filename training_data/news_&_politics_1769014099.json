    "description": "TikTok Ownership Changes to Larry Ellison - What This Means for Political Content Creators\n\nTikTok ownership officially transfers to Larry Ellison and his family on January 22nd, raising serious concerns for political content creators on the platform. Larry Ellison stands as the largest individual donor to Israeli defense funds globally, a hardcore Zionist alongside his son David Ellison, who recently acquired Skydance, Paramount, and CBS. David Ellison installed Barry Weiss to transform CBS News and 60 Minutes into what critics describe as propaganda outlets mirroring Fox News coverage patterns.\n\nThe TikTok ban originated when Jonathan Greenblat identified a \"TikTok problem\" in December following October 7th events. AIPAC and J Street lobbying groups flooded Congress in early 2024, resulting in overwhelming passage of ban legislation under national security pretenses. The underlying issue centered on videos documenting Gaza Strip conditions reaching massive audiences. Joe Biden signed the TikTok ban into law, and now the platform transfers to Zionist ownership interests.\n\nPolitical satire creators face account ban warnings as the transition approaches. Content addressing Israeli policy, Gaza coverage, media manipulation, and government propaganda efforts appears targeted for removal. The CBS News transformation under Barry Weiss oversight demonstrates how media properties change under new ownership aligned with specific political interests.\nYouTube provides an alternative platform for political commentary, comedy, and news analysis without the same ownership constraints. Creators expect rapid changes to TikTok content policies, widespread account bans, and dramatic shifts in algorithmic promotion once Larry Ellison assumes control. The TikTok story represents broader concerns about media consolidation, censorship, and who controls public discourse in digital spaces.\n\n#LarryEllison #DavidEllison #BarryWeiss #JonathanGreenblat #JoeBiden #TikTokBan #TikTok #Gaza #Zionist #AIPAC #CBS #Paramount #October7th #Censorship #MediaConsolidation #FreeSpeech #PoliticalCensorship #SocialMedia #ContentCreators #YouTube #hawk #hawkpodcasts #mdg650hawk #politics #comedy\n\nTimestamps\n00:34 Account ban warnings on main and backup TikTok accounts\n01:09 TikTok ownership changes hands January 22nd to new owners\n02:53 Larry Ellison largest individual donor to Israeli defense funds\n03:35 David Ellison owns Skydance Paramount CBS installed Barry Weiss\n04:08 Jonathan Greenblat declared TikTok problem after October 7th\n04:38 AIPAC and J Street flooded Congress leading to TikTok ban\n04:38 Joe Biden signed TikTok ban legislation into law\n05:15 Moving content to YouTube as TikTok changes approach\n05:15 Expecting dramatic platform changes under new ownership\n05:15 Continuing political commentary on alternative platforms\n\nIf you have the means and want to support Hawk you can become a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCcrmvbQbfwSZaTgBZPrjMQ/join\n\nSUPPORT & CONNECT WITH HAWK\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/mdg650hawk\n- Hawk's Merch Store: https://hawkmerchstore.com\n- Connect on TikTok:  https://www.tiktok.com/@mdg650hawk7thacct\n- Connect on TikTok:  https://www.tiktok.com/@hawkeyewhackamole\n- Connect on BlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/mdg650hawk.bsky.social\n- Connect on Substack: https://mdg650hawk.substack.com\n- Connect on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/mdg650hawk (will be integrating this in the future)\n\n HAWK PODCASTS INFO\n- Additional Content Available Here: \n     - https://www.hawkpodcasts.com or\n     - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCcrmvbQbfwSZaTgBZPrjMQ/join \n\n- Listen to Hawk Podcasts On Your Favorite Platform:\n  \u2022  Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3RWeJfy\n  \u2022  Apple Podcasts: https://apple.co/422GDuL\n  \u2022  YouTube: https://youtube.com/@hawkpodcasts\n  \u2022  iHeartRadio: https://ihr.fm/47vVBdP\n  \u2022  Pandora: https://bit.ly/48COaTB\n  \u2022  Simplecast: https://hawk-droppings.simplecast.com",

    "description": "Political Fallout: Jimmy Kimmel Slammed After Criticizing ICE in MinneapolisThe drama surrounding Jimmy Kimmel did not erupt out of nowhere. It was the result of years of built-up tension finally colliding with the wrong moment, the wrong image, and the wrong national mood. For a long time, Kimmel operated under the assumption that the formula would always protect him. Dress political commentary up as comedy, aim it at the same familiar targets, and trust that applause from the studio audience and praise from Hollywood peers would drown out any backlash. That strategy had worked before. But this time, it failed spectacularly. When his Minneapolis ICE-related comments and the Trump ICE T-shirt stunt hit the airwaves, they landed not as satire but as provocation. Instead of laughs, the reaction was immediate anger. Instead of clever irreverence, viewers saw mockery during a period of real fear and real violence. And once that moment went viral, the consequences moved faster than anyone expected.\nWhat made this situation different was timing. The country was already on edge following the Minneapolis shooting, a moment that carried emotional weight far beyond political alignment. In that environment, Kimmel\u2019s visual gag felt tone-deaf to a massive portion of the audience. It was not just another late-night jab. \n#JimmyKimmel, #BreakingNews, #Banned, #ViralComments, #ICE, #Minneapolis, #MediaBacklash, #PoliticalDrama, #LateNightTV, #FreeSpeechDebate, #CelebrityNews, #TrendingNow, #MediaControversy, #PublicReaction, #HeadlineNews, #CultureWar, #ViralMoment, #NewsBuzz\n\nIT\u2019S OFFICIAL: Jimmy Kimmel Gets BANNED After Minneapolis ICE Comments Go Viral & Blow Back HARD",
