Visualize financial statements like balance sheets, income statements, and cash flows for your favorite stocks to find high quality stocks to buy! Also see my positions in my market beating portfolio! \n\nIn this video, I\u2019m walking you through exactly how I\u2019m selling covered calls to generate monthly income. If you're looking for a way to lower your cost basis and get paid to wait on your favorite stocks, this is for you!\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Want more options strategies? Subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/@YouDomoLLC \ud83d\udcac Question of the Day: Which stock are you currently selling calls against? Let me know in the comments!\n\nWhat are Covered Calls?\nA covered call is a popular options strategy used to generate extra income from stocks you already own. It\u2019s essentially a \"rent-a-stock\" strategy where you get paid upfront in exchange for capping your potential upside.\n\nHow it Works:\nThe Setup: You must own at least 100 shares of a stock (this is your \"cover\").\n\nThe Trade: You sell (write) a call option against those shares.\n\nThe Payoff: You immediately collect a cash payment called a premium.\n\nThe Outcome:\n\nIf the stock stays below the strike price: You keep your shares AND the premium. You can then sell another call to generate more income.\n\nIf the stock rises above the strike price: You are obligated to sell your shares at that price. You keep the premium and any gains up to the strike, but you miss out on any \"moonshot\" rallies.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

    "description": "You're sitting at your desk on a Tuesday, wondering \"How much longer do I have to do this?\" Here's what nobody tells you: almost everyone is obsessed with the wrong number. We chase net worth, but what actually buys freedom is cash flow\u2014real dollars hitting your account every single month.\nThere are three specific passive income milestones that fundamentally change your life. Not in theory. Right now. Today. And most people quit right before they hit the first one.\n\ud83c\udfaf What You'll Learn:\n\nWhy $1,000/month is the most underestimated milestone in personal finance\nThe exact moment passive income stopped being theory and became real for me\nWhy $3,500/month is the \"toxic job shield\" that gives you true leverage\nHow $8,300/month creates full decoupling of time and money\nThe brutal math: how much you actually need invested for each milestone\nWhy the first $1,000/month takes HALF the effort of the entire journey\nThe critical move that separates people who stay stuck from people who accelerate\nWhy most people quit at $500/month (and how close they actually were)\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 The Three Milestones:\nMilestone #1: $1,000/month ($12,000/year)\n\nRequires ~$300,000 invested (using 4% rule) OR sweat equity assets\nThis is PROOF\u2014the moment your brain rewires\nCovers groceries, utilities, car repairs without panic\nTimeline: 9-10 years investing $1,000/month at 8% returns\n\nMilestone #2: $3,500/month ($42,000/year)\n\nRequires ~$1 million invested OR $600K-$800K in rental properties\nThis is SURVIVAL\u2014covers housing, food, transportation\nThe toxic job shield: you can walk away from bad situations\nTimeline: 15-20 years for most people\n\nMilestone #3: $8,300/month ($100,000/year)\n\nRequires ~$2-$2.5 million invested\nThis is ABUNDANCE\u2014full financial independence\nSix-figure income while you sleep, travel, or do nothing\nTimeline: 20-30 years for most disciplined investors\n\n\ud83d\udcca The Uncomfortable Truth:\nThe difference between milestone 2 and 3 is luxury. The difference between milestone 1 and 2 is SURVIVAL. That's why obsessing over the final number too early is a mistake.\nYou don't need $2 million to change your life. You need $1,000/month to prove the concept. You need $3,500/month to escape the trap. Everything after that is just icing.\n\ud83d\udd25 Why Most People Quit:\nPassive income isn't linear\u2014it's exponential. The first $1,000/month consumes HALF the total effort of the entire journey. You're learning skills, building systems, making mistakes, creating infrastructure.\nThat's why people quit at $400 or $500/month. They think \"Three years and I'm making $450/month? Screw this.\" But they don't realize how close they were. Once the foundation exists, scaling becomes dramatically easier.\n\ud83d\udca1 The Only Question That Matters:\nWhere are you right now?\n\nAt zero, trying to figure out which path to take?\nStuck around $500, wondering if it's worth continuing?\nAlready crossed $1,000 and felt the shift?\n\nWherever you are, you're not alone. The math works. It always has. The only variable is whether you stay long enough to let it compound.\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe to Wealth Context for no-BS wealth-building strategies that actually work. No hype. No shortcuts. Just real passive income principles.\n\ud83d\udcac Comment below: Where are you on this journey? $0? $500? $1,000? $5,000? Let's talk about it.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Disclaimer: This content is for educational and entertainment purposes only. I am not a certified financial advisor.

    "description": "Living off passive income is often sold as a dream: money while you sleep, early retirement, total freedom.\nBut the reality is more complicated \u2014 and far more psychological \u2014 than most people admit.\n\nIn this video, I break down the real math behind living off passive income, including the four percent rule, safe withdrawal rates, inflation, and why small percentage differences can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars more saved. We look at why \u201cpassive income\u201d is rarely fully passive, how market downturns can derail early retirement plans, and the hidden risks most people don\u2019t think about until it\u2019s too late.\n\nI also explain the biggest trap of passive income: why hitting your freedom number doesn\u2019t automatically make you feel free, how lifestyle creep quietly raises the bar, and why many people who retire early end up working again \u2014 by choice or necessity.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a hype video.\nIt\u2019s an honest look at the dream vs. reality of passive income, backed by real numbers, real psychology, and real tradeoffs.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in financial independence, early retirement (FIRE), investing for income, or designing a life with more autonomy \u2014 this video will help you think more clearly about what actually works.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Topics Covered\n\nPassive income: dream vs reality\nThe 4% rule explained\nSafe withdrawal rates (3%\u20134%)\nHow inflation affects passive income\nSequence of returns risk\nWhy passive income isn\u2019t truly passive\nThe psychology of financial independence\nFreedom numbers and lifestyle creep\nDesigning life after money\n\n#passiveincome #personalfinance \n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Disclaimer: This video is for entertainment and educational purposes only.

    "description": "Stop waiting for stock prices to go up and start getting paid to OWN them. \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcb0\n\nIn this video, I\u2019m breaking down the two most powerful strategies I use for generating consistent income in the stock market: Covered Calls and Cash-Secured Puts. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to \"collect rent\" from your portfolio or get paid a premium just for waiting to buy a stock you love, this is for you.\n\nWe often hear about the risks of \"options trading,\" but when used correctly, these two strategies can actually lower your risk and provide a steady stream of cash flow\u2014regardless of whether the market is moving up, down, or sideways.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Learn in This Video:\n How Covered Calls allow you to get paid for holding stocks you already own.\n\nHow Cash-Secured Puts pay you to wait for a stock to hit the price YOU want to pay.\n\nLive Examples: I\u2019ll walk you through exactly how the math works so you can start today.\n\nWhy These Strategies?\nInstant Income: Collect the \"premium\" the second you place the trade.\n\nLower Cost Basis: Use options to effectively pay less for your favorite stocks.\n\nConsistency: Perfect for investors looking for monthly cash flow rather than just \"hoping\" for growth.\n\nAre you currently selling options or just buying and holding? Let me know your favorite income ticker in the comments! \ud83d\udc47\n\n\u23f1 Timestamps:\n00:00 Intro\n00:23 Covered Call Overview\n01:27 Selling Puts Overview\n02:39 Covered Call example in Robinhood\n03:42 Selling Put example in Robinhood\n05:29 Final Thoughts \n\nRobinhood referral link where you can earn free money or stocks depending on the promotion they are running: https://join.robinhood.com/mathewd-befdd7\n\nThis is not financial advice.  Do your own research and due diligence!  Make sure you understand the trades you are making.  Enphase and Rocket are two of many stocks I do this with and were just used as examples.  Do not buy those without doing your own due diligence and making sure they fit your risk profile.  I am sharing my strategy on how I grow my portfolio using options.  Please do not copy my exact trades.\n\n\u2705 SUBSCRIBE for more advanced wealth-building and cash-flow strategies. \u2705 LIKE this video if you want more deep dives into options for beginners.\n\n#StockMarket #OptionsTrading #CoveredCalls #CashSecuredPuts #PassiveIncome #FinancialFreedom #InvestingForBeginners",

In this video, I break down proven passive income strategies for 2026 that focus on building multiple income streams, smart investments, and long-term wealth creation.\n\n\nTrue financial freedom doesn\u2019t come from working harder \u2014 it comes from owning systems that generate income. In this video, I explain why having at least three independent businesses that can scale to six figures annually is a powerful foundation for wealth.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll also explore the importance of building a strong investment portfolio, starting with real assets like real estate, alternative income streams such as shipping container rentals, and long-term growth sectors like agro-farming and agricultural investments.\n\n\nIn addition, I share insights on stable crypto investments designed to generate recurring income, not speculation. I also talk about how digital assets like audiobooks can create long-term passive income with the right strategy, and why franchise-based businesses can be one of the most underrated wealth vehicles when structured properly.\n\n\nThis video is not about overnight success or hype \u2014 it\u2019s about thinking like an investor, building assets, and positioning yourself for sustainable wealth in 2026 and beyond.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Watch till the end if you\u2019re serious about building income that works for you, even while you sleep.\n\n\n#PassiveIncome2026\n\n#MillionDollarMindset\n\n#MultipleIncomeStreams\n\n#FinancialFreedom\n\n#WealthBuilding\n\n#Investing2026\n\n#PassiveIncomeIdeas\n\n#SmartInvesting\n\n#EntrepreneurMindset\n\n#AssetBuilding\n\n#MakeMoneyOnline\n\n#LongTermWealth\n\n#BusinessAndInvesting",

If you're new here, don't forget to hit that subscribe button and click the bell icon to get notified whenever we upload new videos.\nUsing Instagram and Social Media to Create Your Online Digital Business with Keys to Engagement.\nHow I Would Sell Digital Products on Instagram (If I Could Start Over) IG Digital Products Strategy.\n\n We're breaking down the top 5 ways you can start earning money while you sleep. But that's not all. Stick around until the end, because I've got a special offer for you\u2014a starter kit that includes everything.\n\nFirst, let's talk about why digital products and courses are such powerful tools for generating passive income. The beauty of digital products is that you create them once and sell them over and over again. Unlike physical products, there's no inventory to manage, no shipping, and your profit margins are much higher. Whether you're looking to supplement your current income or replace it entirely, digital products can help you achieve your goals.\n\nMethod 1 - Creating and Selling E-books\nNumber one on our list is creating and selling e-books. E-books are a fantastic way to share your expertise on any subject you're passionate about. Platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) make it incredibly easy to publish and sell your e-book to a global audience.\n\nWhen writing an e-book, focus on solving a specific problem or addressing a particular need within your niche. Do your research, provide valuable insights, and make your content engaging. Once your e-book is published, you can use social media, email marketing, and SEO to drive traffic to your sales page.\n\nMethod 2 - Developing Online Courses\nThe second method is developing online courses. Platforms like Udemy, Teachable, and Coursera have made it easier than ever to create and sell your own online courses. If you have in-depth knowledge of a particular subject or skill, why not teach others and get paid for it?\nStart by outlining your course curriculum, breaking it down into manageable modules. Use a mix of video lessons, quizzes, and downloadable resources to keep your students engaged. Remember, the more value you provide, the more likely your students are to recommend your course to others.\n\nMethod 3 - Selling Printables and Digital Downloads\nThe third method is selling printables and digital downloads. This can include anything from planners and calendars to design templates and worksheets. Websites like Etsy and Gumroad are perfect for selling these types of products.\n\nThe key to success with printables is creating high-quality, visually appealing products that people will find useful. Consider trends in your niche and design products that meet those needs. You can even bundle multiple items together to increase your sales.\n\nMethod 4 - Membership Sites and Subscription Services\nNext up, we have membership sites and subscription services. If you have a wealth of content or offer ongoing value, a membership site can be a lucrative option. Platforms like Kartra and Kajabi allow you to charge a monthly fee for access to exclusive content, community forums, and more.\n\nTo keep your members engaged and subscribed, consistently provide fresh content and interact with your community. This could include live Q&A sessions, exclusive webinars, and downloadable resources. The goal is to create a sense of belonging and value that keeps your members coming back month after month.\n\nMethod 5 - Licensing Your Content\nFinally, method number five is licensing your content. This involves allowing others to use your digital products, such as e-books, courses, or software, in exchange for a licensing fee. It's a great way to earn passive income from content you've already created.\n\nReach out to businesses, educational institutions, or other content creators who might benefit from your materials. Negotiate a licensing agreement that allows them to use your content while you earn a recurring fee. It's a win-win situation for everyone involved.\n\npassive income\npassive income profits\nstart an online business\nsell digital products online\nbuild passive income with instagram\nhow to earn money online\npassive income online\npassive income streams\nhow to make passive income online\nwork from home\nmake passive income\n\nDiscover how Instagram can serve as your digital storefront, offering a world of opportunity for financial freedom. \nVisit our IG channel \u2068@passiveincomestarterkit\u2069 and click the link in the bio to get the Starter Kit starterkit.systeme.io/home",

Stick around until the end, because I've got a special offer for you\u2014a starter kit that includes everything you need to get your online business up and running for just $27. Let's get started!\n\nFirst, let's talk about why digital products and courses are such powerful tools for generating passive income. The beauty of digital products is that you create them once and sell them over and over again. Unlike physical products, there's no inventory to manage, no shipping, and your profit margins are much higher. Whether you're looking to supplement your current income or replace it entirely, digital products can help you achieve your goals.\n\nMethod 1 - Creating and Selling E-books\nNumber one on our list is creating and selling e-books. E-books are a fantastic way to share your expertise on any subject you're passionate about. Platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) make it incredibly easy to publish and sell your e-book to a global audience.\n\nWhen writing an e-book, focus on solving a specific problem or addressing a particular need within your niche. Do your research, provide valuable insights, and make your content engaging. Once your e-book is published, you can use social media, email marketing, and SEO to drive traffic to your sales page.\n\nMethod 2 - Developing Online Courses\nThe second method is developing online courses. Platforms like Udemy, Teachable, and Coursera have made it easier than ever to create and sell your own online courses. If you have in-depth knowledge of a particular subject or skill, why not teach others and get paid for it?\nStart by outlining your course curriculum, breaking it down into manageable modules. Use a mix of video lessons, quizzes, and downloadable resources to keep your students engaged. Remember, the more value you provide, the more likely your students are to recommend your course to others.\n\nMethod 3 - Selling Printables and Digital Downloads\nThe third method is selling printables and digital downloads. This can include anything from planners and calendars to design templates and worksheets. Websites like Etsy and Gumroad are perfect for selling these types of products.\n\nThe key to success with printables is creating high-quality, visually appealing products that people will find useful. Consider trends in your niche and design products that meet those needs. You can even bundle multiple items together to increase your sales.\n\nMethod 4 - Membership Sites and Subscription Services\nNext up, we have membership sites and subscription services. If you have a wealth of content or offer ongoing value, a membership site can be a lucrative option. Platforms like Patreon or Kajabi allow you to charge a monthly fee for access to exclusive content, community forums, and more.\nTo keep your members engaged and subscribed, consistently provide fresh content and interact with your community. This could include live Q&A sessions, exclusive webinars, and downloadable resources. The goal is to create a sense of belonging and value that keeps your members coming back month after month.\n\nMethod 5 - Licensing Your Content\nFinally, method number five is licensing your content. This involves allowing others to use your digital products, such as e-books, courses, or software, in exchange for a licensing fee. It's a great way to earn passive income from content you've already created.\nReach out to businesses, educational institutions, or other content creators who might benefit from your materials. Negotiate a licensing agreement that allows them to use your content while you earn a recurring fee. It's a win-win situation for everyone involved.\nNow, I promised you something special, didn't I? If you're serious about starting your online business, I've got the perfect solution for you\u2014the Passive Income Starter Kit. This kit includes step-by-step guides, templates, and resources to help you launch your digital product business for just $27.
