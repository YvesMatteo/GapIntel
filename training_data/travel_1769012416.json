I was thankful to have some sweet girlfriends to hike with, a nice puffy jacket to keep me warm, and trail runners to keep me on my toes and alert!   Afterwards, we had a nice hiker tailgate with hot chocolate and finally a few snowflakes! \n\n**********************************\nThank you to Eastman Custom Designs for the SUPER cool Hiker Hang Tag!! \nGo to eastmancustomdesigns.com to create your own! \n\n**********************************\nWAYS TO SUPPORT:\n#1: Prayer \n#2: Encouraging Words \n#3: Become a Trail Angel: Food, Hostels & Supplies :) \n\nVenmo @HikingonaPrayer\nPayPal.me/HikingonaPrayer\nClothing & Stickers: hikingonaprayer.creator-spring.com\n\nCONTACT ME ON THE TRAIL:\nhikingonaprayer@gmail.com \n\n************************************\n\nGear I'm Currently Using: \nhttps://lighterpack.com/r/wymfdj",

From spontaneous trips and lightweight packs to planning months ahead, carrying more gear, and rethinking risk, priorities shift in ways you don\u2019t fully understand until you\u2019re living it.\n\nWe share how becoming parents has changed the way we think about mileage, safety, comfort, time away from home, and even why we go into the woods in the first place. Some things get harder. Some things slow down. And some parts of backpacking become even more meaningful than they ever were before.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about saying one phase is better than the other\u2014it\u2019s about acknowledging that the outdoors still has a place in your life after kids\u2026 it just looks different.",

It was about a two mile hike from the parking lot to the site.\n\nI'm cleaning my phone storage and saw I had these videos I never shared. Stitched them together and now you all can come along this adventure. This was from about over two years ago in the beginning of October. Cool nights and perfectly warm afternoons.\n\nI did some stargazing and it was a perfect night. I shot with just my phone camera, but imagine if it was shot with a DSLR! \n\nThanks for watching and follow me for more! \n\n#Hiking #solobackpacker #doorcounty #stargazing",

    "description": "13 Km Hike Challenge To Day | Pamir Shimshal Part 2 \n\nDiscription \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe \n\nToday we are heading towards Pamir.\nThe route from Shimshal to Pamir usually takes around five days and it can be extremely difficult for us because we have no proper knowledge of the route.\n\nLast night was one of the most dangerous nights of this journey.\n\nThe cold was extreme  around minus -24 degrees Celsius.\nWe slept in the open air  without shelter and somehow managed to survive the night. It was a very tough and exhausting experience.\n\nNow we are moving forward from here towards Second Sarai, which is approximately 13 kilometers away from this point and usually takes about five hours.\n\nThe first half of the route is relatively straight but after that the trail goes steeply uphill making it even more challenging.\nThis journey is especially difficult because we do not know the route and we are traveling without a guide quietly and carefully relying only on our courage and instincts.\n\nAs we move forward on foot we pass through areas that were once devastated by a massive flood in the 1990s, which caused destruction from Hunza to gilgit We will show you those flood-affected locations as well.\n\nBeyond this point  the routes become incredibly beautiful with breathtaking views all around. hi\nHowever beauty comes with danger \u2014 the path is full of difficulties risks and physical exhaustion.\nToday\u2019s biggest challenge is that we must reach Second Hardar without eating pushing our limits in extreme cold and harsh terrain.\n\nlast video \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JHyk5gIu1wE\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe\nInstagram \nhttps://www.instagram.com/mountain_crazy_boy_?\nFacebook \nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?\nYouTube \nhttps://youtube.com/@mountaincrazyboya lo ohh cc\n\nYOUR SEARCH \ud83d\udd0e\nMountain crazy boy\n24 hours challenge\nmountains\nmountain trail\nchallenges \nhikes \nPamir\nshimshal\nHunza \nPakistan\n\nhashtags \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb \n\n#challenges \n#dangerous \n#part2 \n#travel \n#hike \n#mountaincrazyboy \n#hunzavalley \n#pakistan \n#nature \n#singing \n#gilgitbaltistan \n#tajikistan",

They provided us with fire wood and the wood burning stove was perfect for keep us warm when it got to 10 degrees overnight. The views at the yurt and on the way were just amazing. We may have been cold at times but we had the most amazing time and look back on it with fond memories. This is your sign to still adventure even in winter.",
