    "description": "2025 marks a significant milestone for Dharma Drum Mountain\u2014a year of continuing its aspirations while moving toward the future. It will be the 20th anniversary of the inauguration of the World Center for Buddhist Education, the 45th anniversary of the Chung-Hwa Institute for Buddhist Studies, and the 25th anniversary of Sangha University. These auspicious milestones converge, with each step reflecting the concrete practice of the compassionate vows of Master Sheng Yen and the fourfold assembly.\nLooking back on this year, the world continues to change, yet Dharma Drum Mountain\u2019s steps have never ceased. Centered on the principle of \"Protecting the Spiritual Environment,\" the fourfold assembly continues to advance Dharma Drum Mountain\u2019s vision through the Threefold Education: Extensive Public Buddhist Education, Extensive Academic Education, and Extensive Social Care Education, along with international Dharma propagation. In this way, the Dharma becomes integrated into people\u2019s daily lives, accompanies them in settling their minds and bodies, and shares the purity and light of Chinese Chan Buddhism with the world.\nThe 2025 annual theme, \"The Power of Great Aspiration,\" reminds us that the path of compassionate altruism begins with a single pause, a blessing, or a kind thought. Every moment of life is an opportunity to practice this aspiration. We warmly invite you to join us through this video as we reflect on Dharma Drum Mountain\u2019s journey over the past year, realizing our vision of a Pure Land on Earth in each moment.\n\n00:00 introduction\n02:12 Extensive Public Buddhist Education\n06:26 Extensive Academic Education\n08:39 Extensive Social Education\n11:17 International Dharma Propagation   \n13:51 Conclusion\n\n #Spiritual Environmental Protection #Education #environmentalprotection",

    "description": "The world did not change overnight.\nThere was no single war, no single collapse, no single announcement.\n\nBut in 2025, the global system quietly shifted direction.\n\nThis video breaks down the key events, decisions, and hidden patterns of 2025 that are already shaping what 2026 will become \u2014 from global power exhaustion and economic dependency to the collapse of trust, strategic neutrality, and a world moving toward instability rather than explosion.\n\nThis is not a news recap.\nThis is a political analysis of why 2025 was the year the rules changed \u2014 and why misunderstanding it could make 2026 far more dangerous than it appears.\n\nWatch carefully.\nHistory is already moving.\n\n\n\n\u25ba LET'S CONNECT:\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@wikivediaplus\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wikivediaplus\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wikivediaplus\n\nWelcome to Wikivedia+ | Unveiling the Enigmas of Time, Mind, and Science.\n\nAt Wikivedia+, we explore the shadows of history and the fringes of human discovery. Wrapped in a 90s Cinematic documentary aesthetic, our channel serves as a sanctuary for the curious\u2014those who look beyond the surface to find the hidden truths of our world. Our journey is built upon three pillars of mystery:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Experiences That Changed Everything:\nWe revisit historical and scientific experiments that pushed the boundaries of ethics and control. This series explores the profound consequences when human curiosity outpaces caution, leading to outcomes that shocked the world and redefined our understanding of science.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 The Mind... Never Before Seen:\nAn investigation into the extraordinary anomalies of the human brain. From rare neurological conditions to incredible cognitive abilities that defy explanation, we delve into the stories of individuals whose minds operate on a frequency most cannot perceive.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Knowledge Ahead of Its Time:\nUnearthing the artifacts, documents, and technological marvels that simply should not exist in their era. We analyze discoveries from antiquity that suggest our ancestors possessed scientific insights far more advanced than history books dare to admit.\n\nWikivedia+ is more than infotainment; it is an atmospheric descent into the \"why\" and the \"how.\" We aim to inspire, to provoke thought, and to build a community of seekers who dare to question the established narrative.\n\n\ud83d\udcdc NOTE TO OUR SEEKERS:\nWhile we strive for historical and scientific precision through rigorous research, the mysteries we explore are often layered and complex. We encourage you to use our content as a starting point for your own investigation rather than the ultimate truth.\n\n\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f COMMUNITY STANDARDS:\nThis is a platform for respectful dialogue and intellectual curiosity. We maintain a zero-tolerance policy for discriminatory comments. In the digital void, let us remain human.\n\nStep into the darkness with us.

We\u2019ll map what matters using measurable mechanics like order book depth, spreads, and exchange balances, while keeping macro and risk in view. \n\nKey takeaways in this video:\n\u2022 Event signal vs narrative noise: How to distinguish headline impact from what actually shifts liquidity conditions and risk.\n\u2022 Liquidity map: What spreads and order book depth can reveal when attention spikes around XRP.\n\u2022 Flow diagnostics: How exchange balances and net inflows/outflows help validate whether positioning is real or just reaction.\n\u2022 Execution reality: Where slippage and routing quality can change outcomes during high-volatility windows.\n\u2022 Policy and institutional framing: How regulatory phase language can affect corridor adoption expectations and market behavior.\n\n(Tags)\nxrp news,ripple xrp news today,ripple xrp news,xrp today,ripple xrp price,ripple,cryptocurrency,ripple today,xrp news today now,cryptocurrency news,ripple xrp,xrp lawsuit,latest xrp news,crypto news,xrp price prediction,ripple update,xrp ripple news,ripple news,ripple cryptocurrency,ripple daily news,xrp,xrp ripple,xrp news today,xrp price,ripple price,xrp crypto,crypto,crypto news today,bitcoin,xrp update,XRP NEWS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \nWelcome to [Crypto Wire] \u2014 a focused space for XRP, Ripple, and crypto market analysis built around structure, liquidity, and risk.\nHere, we break down XRP news, regulation, on-chain signals, and macro catalysts without noise or hype.\nThe goal is simple: help you think in frameworks, not headlines, and approach markets with discipline and clarity.\n\nIf this framework helps, you\u2019ll find more structured updates like this here.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis content is for educational and informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, investment, legal, or tax advice.

    "description": "#samaatv #GulPlazaFire #KarachiFire  #BreakingNews #KarachiNews #PakistanNews #BuildingCollapse #FireRescue #EmergencyResponse #TragicEvent #KarachiUpdates #LiveNews #GulPlazaTragedy #PakistanBreaking \n\nA massive fire broke out at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on M.A. Jinnah Road, Karachi, late Saturday night, rapidly spreading due to highly flammable goods and poor ventilation. The blaze caused severe structural damage, with parts of the building collapsing, and adjacent structures showing cracks. Rescue operations have been challenging, with dense smoke, extreme heat, and weakened pillars hampering access. At least six people, including a firefighter, have died, while more than 20 others were injured, and dozens remain trapped inside. Sindh Rangers, Pakistan Navy, and over 20 fire tenders are involved in the ongoing rescue effort. Authorities have raised serious concerns about fire safety compliance in the plaza, which houses over 1,200 shops. The Sindh Chief Minister has ordered a detailed inquiry, and the Prime Minister has expressed condolences, ensuring medical care and support for the affected families. \n\nIran Protests & Crackdown Updates (Jan\u202f2026)\nNationwide protests erupted on 28\u202fDec\u202f2025 due to economic hardship, inflation, job losses, and rising living costs. What began as economic demonstrations quickly turned into widespread anti-government protests across major cities, including Tehran, Karaj, Mashhad, and Kurdish regions.\n\nAuthorities responded with a violent crackdown using the IRGC and Basij militias, live ammunition, and heavy weapons. Streets are under heavy patrols, and while public protests have subsided, tensions remain high. A near-total internet blackout since 8\u202fJan\u202f2026 limited reporting, though some connectivity is returning.\n\nCasualty estimates vary widely: official reports confirm ~5,000 killed, while activists and Iranian doctors report up to 16,500 deaths and 330,000 injuries. Tens of thousands have been arrested, with some facing fast-track trials and death sentences.\n\nSupreme Leader Khamenei blamed foreign powers for the unrest, while the US and international bodies condemned the crackdown and threatened sanctions. On the ground, cities show heavy security, closed businesses, and sporadic underground resistance. Diaspora protests continue in cities like Los Angeles and London. The crisis reflects deep economic strain, political repression, and restricted media.\n\nPM Shehbaz reiterates resolve to root out terrorism via unified efforts. Premier says int'l community should acknowledge country's sacrifices as over 100,000 Pakistanis martyred. PM Shehbaz stresses need for collective resolve against terror. Int'l community should acknowledge country's sacrifices: premier. Attaullah Tarar says QPAC to counter hate-based narratives\n\nConsumers deprived of relief as govt raises petroleum levy by up to Rs4.62. Authorities decide to keep fuel prices unchanged for the next fortnight. Govt hikes levy on petrol by Rs4.62 per litre and Re0.80 on HSD. Petroleum Levy on HOBC raised by Rs4.62 per litre. CSL of Rs2.50 per litre on petrol, HSD and HOBC continues\n\nThe channel aims at providing factual, in-depth and latest news as and when it happens. \n\nTune in to SAMAA TV to stay updated, whether at home or on the go, on all things current and relevant.\n\n\u27bd Subscribe to Samaa News \u27bd https://bit.ly/2Wh8Sp8\n\u27bd Watch Samaa News Live \u27bd https://bit.ly/3oUSwAP\n\nStay up-to-date on the major news making headlines across Pakistan on SAMAA TV\u2019s top-of-the-hour segment.

The blaze caused severe structural damage, with parts of the building collapsing, and adjacent structures showing cracks. Rescue operations have been challenging, with dense smoke, extreme heat, and weakened pillars hampering access. At least six people, including a firefighter, have died, while more than 20 others were injured, and dozens remain trapped inside.

The blaze caused severe structural damage, with parts of the building collapsing, and adjacent structures showing cracks. Rescue operations have been challenging, with dense smoke, extreme heat, and weakened pillars hampering access. At least six people, including a firefighter, have died, while more than 20 others were injured, and dozens remain trapped inside. Sindh Rangers, Pakistan Navy, and over 20 fire tenders are involved in the ongoing rescue effort. Authorities have raised serious concerns about fire safety compliance in the plaza, which houses over 1,200 shops. The Sindh Chief Minister has ordered a detailed inquiry, and the Prime Minister has expressed condolences, ensuring medical care and support for the affected families. \n\nIran Protests & Crackdown Updates (Jan\u202f2026)\nNationwide protests erupted on 28\u202fDec\u202f2025 due to economic hardship, inflation, job losses, and rising living costs. What began as economic demonstrations quickly turned into widespread anti-government protests across major cities, including Tehran, Karaj, Mashhad, and Kurdish regions.\n\nAuthorities responded with a violent crackdown using the IRGC and Basij militias, live ammunition, and heavy weapons. Streets are under heavy patrols, and while public protests have subsided, tensions remain high. A near-total internet blackout since 8\u202fJan\u202f2026 limited reporting, though some connectivity is returning.\n\nCasualty estimates vary widely: official reports confirm ~5,000 killed, while activists and Iranian doctors report up to 16,500 deaths and 330,000 injuries. Tens of thousands have been arrested, with some facing fast-track trials and death sentences.\n\nSupreme Leader Khamenei blamed foreign powers for the unrest, while the US and international bodies condemned the crackdown and threatened sanctions. On the ground, cities show heavy security, closed businesses, and sporadic underground resistance. Diaspora protests continue in cities like Los Angeles and London. The crisis reflects deep economic strain, political repression, and restricted media.\n\nPM Shehbaz reiterates resolve to root out terrorism via unified efforts. Premier says int'l community should acknowledge country's sacrifices as over 100,000 Pakistanis martyred. PM Shehbaz stresses need for collective resolve against terror. Int'l community should acknowledge country's sacrifices: premier.

Authorities decide to keep fuel prices unchanged for the next fortnight. Govt hikes levy on petrol by Rs4.62 per litre and Re0.80 on HSD. Petroleum Levy on HOBC raised by Rs4.62 per litre.
