## ✅ Verified Content Gaps (Ready to Act On)

*These gaps were verified against your recent video transcripts.*

### 🔴 1. Platform tutorials

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | TRUE_GAP |
| **User Struggle** | New traders are unsure how to use trading platforms (e.g., thinkorswim) |
| **Engagement** | 1,500 |
| **Verification** | No mention found |

**Why This is a Gap:** A complete lack of platform tutorials on the channel presents a foundational knowledge gap for new traders. Addressing this directly can attract beginners and build a loyal following.  

**💡 Suggested Titles:**
1. Thinkorswim for BEGINNERS: Stop Guessing, Start Trading!
2. Trading Platforms EXPOSED: The TRUTH They Don't Want You To Know!
3. Thinkorswim Tutorial: From Confused to Confident Trader (in 15 Minutes!)

### 🔴 2. Tax implications

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | TRUE_GAP |
| **User Struggle** | Beginner doesn't know how trading affects taxes |
| **Engagement** | 1,500 |
| **Verification** | No mention found |

**Why This is a Gap:** The absence of tax-related content leaves beginners vulnerable to costly mistakes. This is a high-value topic that traders actively search for, especially around tax season.  

**💡 Suggested Titles:**
1. Trading Taxes: The ULTIMATE Guide for Beginners (Don't Get Audited!)
2. Trading Profits DESTROYED by Taxes? (How to Avoid Common Mistakes)
3. Tax Season for Traders: SIMPLE Strategies to Save You Money

### 🟡 3. Risk management

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | UNDER_EXPLAINED |
| **User Struggle** | Unclear how much capital to risk on each trade |
| **Engagement** | 1,500 |
| **Verification** | While many videos talk about strategy and profits, only 'How I Make $10,000/Month Trading With Only $500' touches on capital, but not in the context of risk management on each trade. |

**Why This is a Gap:** While mentioned in passing, a dedicated explanation of risk management principles, especially regarding capital allocation per trade, is lacking. This is crucial for long-term trading success.  

**💡 Suggested Titles:**
1. STOP Losing Money: The ONE Risk Management Rule You NEED To Know
2. Risking Too Much? This Trading Mistake Will WIPE YOU OUT!
3. How Much Should You REALLY Risk Per Trade? (The TRUTH About Capital)

### 🟡 4. Backtesting

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | UNDER_EXPLAINED |

| **Engagement** | 1,500 |
| **Verification** | 'My Super Easy Scalping Strategy I Use Every Day (Backtested Results)' and 'My Incredibly Easy Strategy That Makes Me $600/Day (Backtested Results)' mention backtesting, but the process of backtesting itself is not deeply explained. |

**Why This is a Gap:** Backtesting is often mentioned but the *how* and *why* of proper backtesting methodology is not explained. A dedicated tutorial would fill this gap.  

**💡 Suggested Titles:**
1. Backtesting SECRETS: How to ACCURATELY Test Your Trading Strategy
2. Backtesting TRAPS: AVOID These Mistakes When Testing Strategies!
