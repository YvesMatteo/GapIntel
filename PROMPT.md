# User Objective
Systematic Science-Backed Implementation Review & Perfection

## Core Goal
Methodically review every feature in the codebase (specifically ML and Analysis pipelines) to ensure they are:
1. **Perfectly Implemented**: Code is clean, robust, and follows best practices.
2. **Scientifically Backed**: No heuristics, no random numbers. Models use proper ML/Statistical methods (Confidence Intervals, Decay Curves, etc.).
3. **Sensible Results**: The outputs make logical sense and provide genuine value to YouTubers (actionable insights).

## Secondary Goal
Create a detailed **Requirements List** for the user (e.g., "Add X to Supabase SQL Editor", "Provide API Key Y") needed to finalized the production environment.

## Context
We have just completed a "Scientific Validity Overhaul" (Phases 1-10). This loop is a final rigorous check ("Ralph Mode") to double-check everything and polish the edge cases.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All ML Predictors (Viral, Views, CTR, Sentiment) are verified as scientifically sound.
- [ ] Codebase is free of "lazy" heuristics in critical paths.
- [ ] `REQUIREMENTS_LIST.md` is created with clear instructions for the user.
- [ ] The Project is ready for "Product Launch" quality.
